## The Idea

An idea I was hoping to launch back when I was in NS was a book series for Muslims kids. The concept was straightforward. Seeing how most children books have rather straightforward storylines, I thought it might be good if we can bundle it up with simple yet oft-forgotten sunnahs that Muslims are encouraged to apply in our everyday lives.

This way, when parents / caregivers are reading the books to their children, they can introduce the simple sunnahs to the children. And when the chidlren are doing such activities in real life, the caregiver can also remind them of the story book and relate back to the things that they can practice.

Another added benefit of such a book is for the parents themselves to be reminded of such sunnahs, and to incorporate them as routines in the family.

## Why It Didn't Happen

Back then during NS, I was serious about trying to get this concept off the ground. I bounced off the idea with several close friends, and worked with a couple of them who were ready to put in the work with me: Namely Ustaz Luqman Hakim and Sensei Harith Hamzah. In total, we manage to fully draft 4 books to make up our first series. We even had some of our teachers to vet them. We were on quite a momentum, but we just didn't get to the last half of the marathon to see it through.

The barrier that we never passed was the illustration bit. We tried to do it ourselves, but weren't skilled enough. We did not have the funds to hire for this. We engaged someone who was willing to do it pro bono, but it never got done. After a substantial period being stuck here, I guess over time, we just stopped working on it.

Note that this was a mini side project for us, so as much as we had the conviction of getting it done, we weren't laser focused on it. Perhaps that's a big reason too.

Here are some snippets of our draft.

Ahh, the effort with the rhymes... They were mainly written by Ustaz Luqman Hakim to make it more fun. _Cute, right?! ðŸ˜‹_

## What Now

At this moment, I think the book is too advanced for me to realistically publish. Knowing more about launching projects now, I think that even if I get them illustrated and published, a lot of effort and commitment will still be required to get it in front of the audience we were envisioning for. So for now, I'm still going to keep those drafts in the archive.

However, now that I have Hadif, I think the concept is more relevant than ever. My wife and me want to share with Hadif the simple sunnahs that we can practice in our daily lives in a fun and engaging way. Reading books to him about it might just be another avenue for this. As a family, we are also forming routines for us to be consistent in. So it seems like a good time for us to compile these sunnahs and routines that makes sense in our daily lives, and share it with others. Perhaps in a form of this story book series.

As such, I'm thinking of coming up with a MUCH simplified version of the book than what my friends and I have drafted. Simplify the storylines, and make the takeaways obvious and straightforward to make it easy for both parents and readers to sieve out the learning points.

## The Prototype

With that in mind, I came up with the prototype of the first book: "My Daily Dua", and I wrote it by imagining things from Hadif's perspesctive. hehe.

The story book will be super simple: 1 page for Hadif's script, and another for the Dua itself. All the way till the end.

You can view the prototype here:

_NOTE: The baby Images are just placeholders grabbed via Google images to visualise how it might look like._

We are also thinking of compiling the dua as flashcards, so that readers can have fun memorising with it, or it can be placed where the dua is expected to be read as a form of reminder.

All just a prototype an idea still at the moment.

## Worthwhile?

What do you think about the concept and the prototype? Let me know if you think it's worthwhile for us to go deep in this please! Will only consider to work on it if we can convince ourselves that it will be!
