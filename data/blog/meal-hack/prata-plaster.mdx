## The Motivation

There are quite a number of benefits in preparing our own meals. Here are 3 key benefits that are appealing to me:

1. It is typically more cost-effective
1. It can be therapeutic when done alone, and can be treated as bonding time when done together
1. We can know (almost) exactly what are in our meals

One big issue I thought it had is the time and energy required in preparing for the meal itself.

To counter this, over the past years, I have been looking for super simple (and cost-effective) meal hacks that I can quickly prepare myself. One that would require even less time and energy than buying a meal from a nearby coffee shop.

## Quick & Cheap Meal Hacks

Now that I have found some, I thought of creating this segment in my blog where I share the ones I personally like. Who knows some of you might like it too!

The meal hacks in this segment will specifically be for those that are super quick and cheap to prepare ourselves. To remain focused on this, I'll try to always include the total estimated cost, along with the total estimated time required to prepare it.

## Prata Plaster - _an old favourite!_

This particular meal hack is something new for me, and I love it! ðŸ˜‹

Actual items that I had to buy from Sheng Siong to prepare this:

1. Prata instant (30pcs) - $6.95
1. Eggs (10pcs) - $2.65
1. Butter spread (500g) - $3.90

_Disclaimer: Typically, I try to avoid instant/processed food in my meal preps (a lil ironic considering it's my 1st entry, I know. haha), but... since this is something I just tried, and the ingredients looks harmless, I thought I'll just share it. ðŸ˜…_

### The Breakdown

![Prata Plaster Breakdown](/static/blog/meal-hack/prata-plaster-breakdown.png)

1. 1 x prata instant - $0.25~
1. 1 x egg - $0.25~
1. 0.5 x tablespoon of butter (7g) - $0.05~

#### Total estimated cost: $0.55 ðŸ’°

#### Total estimated time: 6 minutes

P.s. most of the time is just waiting for the prata instant to be cooked on both sides .
