## Why I agreed to be part of it

When I was approached to come on board as part of the human library in the Young Mendaki Club's Explore programme, I was pitched that it's to share my career experience and advice to juniors including those from Madrasah. I typically avoid joining events in favour of working on my side projects, but I decided to give a quick yes for this one.

I saw this as another opportunity to get my juniors from Madrasah to reflect on our intention in seeking knowledge, and as an extension, in choosing our next steps (In particular, they were looking at their options after olevels).

I also wanted to try to move them away from thinking too much about what education path will lead them to a lucrative career. Rather, place a much higher priority in considering the kind of contribution that they would want to make in the future.

The desire to contribute something of substantial impact could then provide us the motivation we need, and be the compass that guides us to keep acquiring more useful knowledge and skills. A possible side effect would ideally lead us to be experts in the field altogether insyaallah.

Of course, earning sufficiently is important. But it should only be looked at as a means to an end.

Essentially, since we are probably going to spend the bulk of our productive time in our whole life on our formal education and full-time career, I feel that it's important for us to strategise our education and career path around a life mission. One which could help us achieve our ultimate goal in the hereafter, insyaallah.

This whole thing might sound full of fluff, and might indeed be simplistic. But it's a concept that I personally still believe in and hold on to. The mindset itself was something my teachers back in Irsyad had instilled in me, which I'm eternally grateful for.
