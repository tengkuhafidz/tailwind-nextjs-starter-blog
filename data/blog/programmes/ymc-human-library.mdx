## Why I agreed to be part of it

When I was approached to come on board as part of the human library in the Young Mendaki Club's Explore programme, I was pitched that it's to share my career experience and advice to juniors including those from Madrasah. I had a quick look at my calendar, and said yes when I noticed that I have not had anything planned yet on that day.

I take it as another opportunity to get my juniors from Madrasah to reflect on our intention in seeking knowledge, and as an extension, in choosing our next steps (In particular, they were looking at their options after olevels).

I also wanted to try to _unbrainwash_ them from thinking too much about what education path will lead them to a lucrative career. Rather, place a much higher priority in considering the kind of contribution that they would want to make in the future.

Essentially, tie our education and career path to our life mission of wanting to contribute something valuable to this world. A life mission that could be counted as good deeds, and perhaps even Jihad, in the here after.

The desire to contribute something of substantial impact could then provide us the motivation we need, and be the compass that guides us to keep acquiring more useful knowledge and skills. The side effect would ideally lead us to be experts in the field itself, which typically mean that we might not need to worry about our career too insyaallah.

This might sound full of fluff, and might indeed be simplistic. But it's a concept that I personally still believe in and hold on to. The mindset itself was something my teachers back in Irsyad had instilled in me, which I'm eternally grateful for.
