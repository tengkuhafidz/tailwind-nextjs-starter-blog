## Why The Interest in Investment

I have always had this goal of wanting to be financially independent some day. Ever since secondary school, I have had the mindset to be prudent in my spending, and doing proper financial planning to increase my chances of realising this hope. Perhaps I'll share about the motivation for this in a separate blog post in the future, because it is something that is close to my heart.

After establishing good habits in prudent spending and saving up, i knew that the next step I have to get into is investing. Here are snippets of my experience in getting started in the different forms of investments.

## The Challenge

The biggest hurdle for me to start investing is the lack of knowledge around it. Every time I get the motivation to get into it, I'll get overwhelmed by the research phase itself. There's just so many different avenues and strategies. Having to understand the technicalities around it, deciding if the risk vs rewards are worth it, on top of having to be confident if it is sharia-compliant... it's just a lot of friction.

## Investing in Gold

During NS, I managed to save up a quite an amount of money for someone like me. It's the first time I see such a figure on my bank account. Towards the end of it, I realise that since I will not have any more income after that, all these moolahs saved will stay stagnant. And I've heard multiple times of how I should start investing as early as possible as the impact over the long run can be significant. Even worse, if I don't, there is no doubt the the money will lose out to inflation. So I knew I needed to start investing right away.

But I still had no clue on how to invest the Halal + profitable way. I have tried engaging with an Islamic financial advisor, but I left the discussion unconvinced of making a good investment via what was shared. So I dropped that option.

That was when I decided to just go long and low-risk by investing / storing the value of some of my savings into gold. It's considered by many as a safe haven, and the value does look like it will (slowly) rise over the long term, albeit not having the most exciting of movements. Haha. So that was how I got started in "investment".

## Investing via Wahed Invest Roboadvisor

When I was in NUS, I got to know of this new (back then) startup called [Wahed Invest](https://wahedinvest.com/).

It's a sharia-complaint robo-advisor. I was instantly interested as this would remove the barriers in investment. All I have to do is to deposit, and this platform is supposed to do the investing for me by finding investment options that is suitable to my risk tolerance - all without me having to worry about it's halal-ness.

Of course there were concerns initially if I can trust the platform, but these 2 things allowed me to gain confidence of it.

1. [Syakir Hashim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/syakirhashim/), someone I know and trust, is a high-ranked person in Wahed Invest
2. [Sheikh Dr. Yasir Qadhi](https://journal.wahedinvest.com/sheikh-dr-yasir-qadhi-joins-as-our-ethical-advisor/) became the ethical advisor of Wahed Invest

As a total noob, regardless of how much I would actually make by the end of it, I felt it is a no-brainer for someone like me who have been wanting to get a taste into stock-based investments.

So having the confidence in the product and the people in it, I went on to place a small investment into it. Of course, at that time, I was not earning an income, so I only did it as a one-off thing.

When I started working, I wanted to invest more into it, but then I realised they longer support singapore investors as how they did before. I mean, we cna still invest in it, but the transaction fee does not look worth it at the moment. So I shave stopped using this totally now.

## Investing in SGX

When the pandemic happened, I came across a number of videos on Youtube showing how it is actually an opportunity to invest when the market has gone down so much. This certainly peaked my curiousity about investing once again. in previous pandemic,
