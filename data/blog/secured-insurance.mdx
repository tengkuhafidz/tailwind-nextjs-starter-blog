## We Did It

I've always acknowledged the importance of having a good insurance plan, but it's been very tough to convince myself of the best plans to go for. I guess it will always be as such as we won't ever know what we truly need in the future.

So my wife and me just told ourselves try our best in doing our due diligence, and leave the rest to Allah.

After consulting a number of financial advisors, we decided on a financial advisor whom both of us resonate with the most. We had a number of back and forth, and inbetween it, we also did informal consultations with family and friends whome we trust. Alhamdulillah, all of their input helped to shape up the plan that we are finally confident with. We had to keep making changes though to the proposal that our financial advisor had crafted for us - all the way till right before we confirm and secure the final plan,which is tonight! huhu. Alhamdulillah, it's all done now.

Although we feel more secured now that we have covered ourselves with an insurance plan that we have carefully crafted, we pray that we never have to trigger the claims. May Allah protect our family and grant us good health. Ameen.
