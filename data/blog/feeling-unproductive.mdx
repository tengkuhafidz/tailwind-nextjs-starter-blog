## Where is the light

It's been about a month since I get to seriously work on my side projects. And I still cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel yet.

Having a baby certainly have a lot to do with this. Hadif is growing so fast, and with each growth milestone, more attention towards him is required to help him develop as best as possible. He is also getting more active, which requires us to monitor him more closely. _Not complaining though! Alhamdulillah for having such an happy, and healthy baby._

When he's asleep, I find myself having to clear some house chores and responding to messages from various groups and individuals. The messages are mainly either from friends discussing about issues close to heart, or those who are seeking for my help in the tech aspects of their projects. These typically fill up most of my time.

And whenever I'm done with the different random errands, it's either bed time, or my fulltime work is about to start, or little Mr Hadif is awake once again.

## Taking a step back

Found some time the other day early in the morning, so I listed down all the different routine tasks and goals that I want to focus on. I then tried to categorise and reprioritise them, and try to fit them into my expected daily schedule. I have somewhat done the first part, but have yet to complete the second part in the details that it requires.

Hoping for a more fulfilling month ahead, once I get this in place. Ameen.
