## Context: Hadif has evolved into a crawling baby

Hadif can crawl now. And of course he loves to go to places that would concern us right. üòÇ

One of his favourite go-to is this very low power socket in the guest room. _I think this is specifically built for crawling babies smh... ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è_

I asked my wife if there is something we can buy to keep the power socket out of reach from Hadif. That was when it hit me. It might be a fun idea to DIY something simple ourselves! ü§ì

## Building the First Iteration

**The main consideration:** Something that makes it difficult for Hadif to get access to the power socket, yet still remains easy for us.

**The initial assumption:** Hadif might not be sophisticated enough to know how to operate a door mechanism.

**The prototype:**

1. Took an existing box we have lying around that can somewhat fit the dimensions of the said power socket
2. Carved out the box with pen knife and tape for it to snugly fit the said power socket
3. Made a simple door-like mechanism on the front

## Testing the First Iteration

We then did a usability testing with our user, Mr Crawling Baby.

He repeated things like the below gif for about a minute. All looked good.

Buuuut once we turned off the camera, our celebrations turned into a burst of laughter when he actually managed to take it off by somehow pulling it out. We only managed to capture what happens right after _(where he almost fell - shocked from our burst of laughter. Oooops, sorry Hadif üòÖ)_.

## Building the Second Iteration

The fix for this should be simple. To tape the box to the wall itself.

Doest not look the most elegant, but hey, it works. _or so we hope_. I wanted to avoid taping to the wall initially, as it will most likely remove the paint with it when we remove it in the future. But since Hadif has shown that he can pull it out, it looks like we don't have a choice. Gotta do what we gotta do, and deal with the consequences later, if any. üôÉ

## Testing the Second Iteration

As per procedure, we then call in Mr Crawling Baby for usability testing again.

This time, he did something we did not expect. He proved our initial assumption wrong! He was actually smart enough to operate the door mechanism. ü§Ø

Disappointed that the job is not done yet, but definitely more proud of our crawling baby.

## Building the Third Iteration

That was when I upgraded the door mechanism. For it to be current-Hadif-proof, it needs to have a "lock" mechanism. This is made with just a simple tape + a mini piece of paper at the end so that we can peel the tape off and on easily.

## Testing the Third Iteration

Here's Mr Crawling Baby's full inspection for this third iteration.

He did all the QC tests - the knock, smack, pull, and even the bite tests. And it holds strong still. Looks like this iteration is a winner, alhamdulillah! üéâ

## DIYs are Always Fun & Fulfilling (when it works)

As simple as it is, it's always quite fulfilling for me when we can pull off some DIYs with whatever that we have lying around. Let's see how long this thing actually lasts.

Till the next post üëãüèΩ
